            <p><b>Hobbies:</b> Indulging in Bravo tv shows! She also enjoys
                cooking and reading cookbooks.
                <b>Favorite Foods:</b> Macaroni and Cheese, any salad from Sweet Green, and neapolitan ice
                cream!
                <b>First thing she does in the morning:</b> Takes a breath, because most days might be
                challenging
                but if she's reminded that every step she takes from that point on is just as intentional as
                taking
                a breath
                she can confidently conquer anything!</p>

            <p><b>Favorite US City:</b> Atlanta, GA
                <b>Favorite Concert:</b> Brian McKnight. Denise wishes that she were born in the late
                80's
                so that she could have experienced the 90's like her older sister!</p>
            <p><b>Professional Background:</b> With 5 years of project management experience Denise has lead
                software
                development projects ranging from $120k - $2M
                using Waterfall and Agile Methodologies. Her experience in both the public and private sectors
                has
                equipped her to support
                larger programs in various organizational structures.
                <b>Education:</b> Spelman College (BS) & Kennesaw State University (MS)</p>
